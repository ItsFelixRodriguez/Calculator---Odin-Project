# Calculator---Odin-Project

Okay this will be the big one. I will stick with this one as long as it takes to make it work. 

10/5 -- Successfully built the CSS Grid for the calculator buttons. 
Things to do still:
- Tweak the colors to make the design look more in line with what I am looking for.
- Get the numbers to display upon click event.
